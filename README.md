## Description: 
This project is part of a webpage creation challenge for Prepr.
The objective was to recreate https://preprlabs.org/user/home and https://preprlabs.org/createProject/0 pages using any framework (I chose React).
    
Additional Objectives:
- All mouseover effects need to work. But you only need to implement the following click events: create a button on the dashboard page, create a button for a cover image, create a button on the project detail page.
- The design needs to be responsive.
- You do not need to consider the accessibility button in this challenge.
- Select only 10 fields, including a cover image, on https://preprlabs.org/createProject/0 to create the project. You do not need to implement all fields.
- Feel free to re-design these pages to showcase your creativity.
